← [Home](../index.html)

## 👋 Introduction

This section is a **long-form, engineering-first knowledge base** on how real fintech systems are designed, built, and operated in production.

It is written for:

* Senior software engineers
* Tech leads and architects
* Engineers working in or moving into fintech

The focus is **not** on SDK usage or surface-level integrations. Instead, this series explains the *foundations* of fintech systems — money movement, ledgers, compliance, risk, and architecture — in a way that helps engineers make **better design decisions**.

## 🎯 How to Use This Series

You do not need to read everything in order, but the articles are structured progressively:

1. Start with **Payments** to understand how money enters and leaves systems
2. Move to **Core Banking** to understand how money is recorded and protected
3. Learn **Compliance & Fraud** to understand constraints and risks
4. Study **Architecture** to see how systems scale safely
5. Explore **Products & Analytics** to connect engineering with business reality
6. Finish with **Global Platforms** to internalize real-world trade-offs

Each article can be revisited independently as a reference.

## 🧭 Final Note

This knowledge base is intentionally conservative in tone and design. Financial systems demand **correctness, clarity, and discipline** over novelty.

If you are building or leading fintech systems, these principles will help you avoid costly mistakes and design platforms that can survive scale, audits, and time.
