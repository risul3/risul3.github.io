← [Home](../index.html)

## 👋 Introduction

This section is a **long-form, engineering-first knowledge base** on how real fintech systems are designed, built, and operated in production.

It is written for:

* Software engineers
* Tech leads and architects
* Engineers working in or moving into fintech

The focus is **not** on SDK usage or surface-level integrations. Instead, this series explains the *foundations* of fintech systems — money movement, ledgers, compliance, risk, and architecture — in a way that helps engineers make **better design decisions**.

## 🎯 How to Use This Series

You do not need to read everything in order, but the articles are structured progressively:

1. Start with **Payments** to understand how money enters and leaves systems
2. Move to **Core Banking** to understand how money is recorded and protected
3. Learn **Compliance & Fraud** to understand constraints and risks
4. Study **Architecture** to see how systems scale safely
5. Explore **Products & Analytics** to connect engineering with business reality
6. Finish with **Global Platforms** to internalize real-world trade-offs

Each article can be revisited independently as a reference.

## 📘 Articles Overview

### 1. [Payment Systems in Fintech](payment-systems.html)

A deep, end-to-end explanation of authorization, settlement, card networks, wallets, chargebacks, and operational realities.

---

### 2. [Core Banking Systems](core-banking.html)

How banks actually work internally — ledgers, double-entry accounting, balances, reversals, interest calculation, RTGS, ACH, and virtual accounts.

---

### 3. [Compliance & Regulation in Fintech](compliance-regulation.html)

An engineering-centric view of KYC, AML, PCI-DSS, audit trails, access control, and why compliance must be built into system design.

---

### 4. [Fraud & Risk Engines](fraud-risk.html)

A detailed exploration of rule engines, risk scoring, velocity checks, device fingerprinting, ML boundaries, and human-in-the-loop operations.

---

### 5. [Fintech Architecture & Distributed Financial Systems](architecture-distributed-systems.html)

Why fintech architecture is different — ledgers as truth, event-driven systems, idempotency, sagas, reconciliation, and operational safety.

---

### 6. [Financial Products & Instruments](financial-products.html)

An engineer’s guide to loans, BNPL, installments, cards, FX, remittances, treasury, and liquidity management.

---

### 7. [Fintech Analytics & KPIs](analytics-kpis.html)

Metrics that actually matter — authorization rate, fraud rate, chargebacks, settlement accuracy, reconciliation gaps, and cost of payments.

---

### 8. [Studying Global Fintech Platforms](global-platforms.html)

Reverse engineering Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, Wise, Revolut, and M-Pesa to understand why mature fintech systems look the way they do.

## 🧭 Final Note

This knowledge base is intentionally conservative in tone and design. Financial systems demand **correctness, clarity, and discipline** over novelty.

If you are building or leading fintech systems, these principles will help you avoid costly mistakes and design platforms that can survive scale, audits, and time.
